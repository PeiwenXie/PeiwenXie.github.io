Xie Peiwen is currently a doctoral candidate in the quantitative modeling track of marketing at [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/) and is expected to graduate in 2025. As an empirical modeler, Peiwen is deeply passionate about investigating business phenomena underlying unstructured data, combining machine learning techniques with econometric models. Her current research explores topics on creator economy, mystery products, AI adoption, and innovation.

For her dissertation research on the digital art market, Peiwen delves into consumer decision-making and selling strategies with uncertainty. Specifically, she examines (1) herding behavior in NFT auctions and the interplay of visual characteristics and herding tendency, and (2) the value of probabilistic selling in helping sellers improve their sales performance, and the underlying mechanisms.
